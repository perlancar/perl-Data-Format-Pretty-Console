Revision history for Data-Format-Pretty-Console

0.11     2011-08-11

         No functional changes. Added Data::Format::Pretty::Text which is a
         shortcut for formatting with Console with option interactive=1, while
         Data::Format::Pretty::SimpleText is a shortcut for interactive=0.


0.10     2011-07-28

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - In interactive (table) mode, no longer prints header row for array,
           hash, and aoa data (they are quite meaningless anyway, respectively:
           "data", "key, value", and "col0, col1, ..."). No changes in
           non-interactive (tab-separated text) mode, since headers are never
           printed.


0.09     2011-06-15

         No functional changes. Internally restructured as OO to allow being
         subclassed by Data::Format::Pretty::HTML.


0.08     2011-05-20

         - Add option: table_column_orders.


0.07     2011-02-23

         Scalar formatting: don't add newline when scalar already ends with
         newline.


0.06     2011-02-06

         Stringify objects (suggested by JOHANL) [resolved rt#65357].

         Add option: interactive


0.04     2011-01-13

0.03     2010-12-24

         Pretty print hash of hashes.


0.02     2010-11-20

         In displaying list/hash, list elements/hash values are now "cells"
         (short scalars or short arrays) instead of just scalars.

         Rewrite tests.
